## About

This sample React application lets you quickly play with simple React concepts in your local browser. It uses client-side Babel to transpile JSX to JavaScript on the fly. You will need to run these files from a local web server to avoid browser security issues.

Each component has a [class-based](https://www.pragimtech.com/blog/reactjs/introduction-to-class-components-in-react/) and function-based version. This allows you two view them side-by-side to compare the syntax, logic, and readability differences between each.
